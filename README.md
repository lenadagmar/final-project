Our metric: The best neighborhood is the prettiest one!

We will find the prettiest neighborhood by analyzing the amount of parks, public art displays, bridges and greenways in each neighborhood.

Lena's folder contains the databases on **Parks** and **Art**. Vaishu's folder contains the databases on **Greenways** and **Bridges**.

**Lena's Datasets:**
